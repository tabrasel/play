				This is a regular old "container". I don't think this one spans the whole width of the parent, but let's see. This bad boy is left aligned so I just want to write enough to span a couple lines. By defaut it looks like the container itself is horizontally centered within its parent which is actually really nice.

				Now I know that was very fun and all, but let's try out the "container-fluid", which I believe actually spans the whole width of the parent. Looks like it does just that. Nice. What I really want to know though is how a parent might be affected by having one of these in it, or how containers influence each other in general. Let's try that next.

					Alright! a fluid-container in a regular container! I notice I can still see a bit of the top container, and also some space between the the paragraph and its own parent container. Looking at the box model, I see that both types of container have a padding of 15px to the left and right. I also notice that this whole section is just as wide as the first container div I made, which must mean that the fluid container does not influence the width of its parent. Good thing to keep in mind.

					This is an example of a container inside a fluid container. I'm going to predict that this paragraph inside will be located in the same place as the first container div I made way up top. Cool, I was right, the fluid container padding doesn't really affect its contents(at least with this big of a screen).
