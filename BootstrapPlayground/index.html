		<h2 class="text-center">Containers</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<p>
				This is a regular old <code>container</code>. I don't think this one spans the whole width of the parent, but let's see. This bad boy is left aligned so I just want to write enough to span a couple lines. By defaut it looks like the container itself is horizontally centered within its parent which is actually really nice.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="container-fluid">
			<p>
				Now I know that was very fun and all, but let's try out the <code>container-fluid</code>, which I believe actually spans the whole width of the parent. Looks like it does just that. Nice. What I really want to know though is how a parent might be affected by having one of these in it, or how containers influence each other in general. Let's try that next.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<p>
					Alright! a <code>fluid-container</code> in a regular <code>container</code>! I notice I can still see a bit of the top container, and also some space between the the paragraph and its own parent container. Looking at the box model, I see that both types of container have a padding of 15px to the left and right. I also notice that this whole section is just as wide as the first container div I made, which must mean that the fluid container does not influence the width of its parent. Good thing to keep in mind.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="container-fluid">
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					This is an example of a <code>container</code> inside a <code>fluid-container</code>. I'm going to predict that this paragraph inside will be located in the same place as the first container div I made way up top. Cool, I was right, the fluid container padding doesn't really affect its contents (at least with this big of a screen). But when I make the screen very narrow, both types of nested containers have the same width since now all of their padding takes effect.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2 class="text-center">The Grid System</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					We're gonna be diving into the grid system now. Before things get too off the rails, what does a row do for us? Let's take a look. Woah! For some reason I can't see the "container"'s horizontal padding! The box model is telling me that "row"s have horizontal margins of -15px, meaning that they exactly counteract the <code>container</code> padding of 15px. Therefore it appears that the row fits <em>exactly</em> within the container with no space in between.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					Now I'm curious: How about a <code>container</code> just filled with a few rows?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					Row numbah two.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					The Three Musketeers. No curveballs here.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="container-fluid">
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					How about a <code>fluid-container</code> with rows?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					George II.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					The Three Amigos. Again, no curveballs. The rows span the <em>entire</em> width and height of their parent container.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="container text-justify">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>
						Let's get into columns now. I still am not sure how to use sm, lg, and whatever medium is. This is a <code>col-lg-4</code>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>
						I think the <code>lg</code> part means that these columns will work as normal columns until the screen size is <code>lg</code>, which means 992px wide.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>
						If the screen is any smaller that lg, then the columns are broken up into individual rows.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row align-items-center">
				<div class="col-lg-3">
					<p>
						Adding a second row doesn't give any strange results, thank goodness. Let's play around with the column widths, shall we? This row is also has its items center aligned!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-9">
					<p>
						All in all, grids seem pretty manageable. The documentation says to only put content (like the <code>&ltp&gt</code> all this is written in) inside columns. So if you had a row in a grid that wasn't broken up into columns, would that mean you'd have to create one column in that row? That seems wasteful...
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>
						Heck, let's do it. This is a <code>col-lg-12</code>. Something to keep in mind with columns is that they each have horizontal paddings of 15px (positive). All in all, for this column we go from <code>container</code> padding +15px -> <code>row</code> margin -15px -> <code>column</code> padding +15px to end up with an offset of 15px. Whew! This also means that there are 30px between columns.
